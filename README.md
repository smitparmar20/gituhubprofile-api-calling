This React-based app fetches and displays GitHub user profiles. Users input a username, triggering an API call to fetch data like avatar, location, bio, repositories, followers, and account creation date. Details are shown in a Bootstrap-styled card, with a link to the GitHub profile. Features include a loading state and dynamic updates. Enhancements could include better error handling and input validation.
